# quad\_slice


**VERSION:** 1.3.0 *(see CHANGELOG.md for breaking changes from 1.2.1)*


QuadSlice is a 9-Slice drawing library for LÖVE.


![screen_quad_slice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23288188/184142728-87a97b4e-e0a2-4c34-bac8-50f3c1f5d45f.png)


# Usage Example


```lua
local quadSlice = require("quad_slice")

local image = love.graphics.newImage("demo_res/9s_image.png")

-- (The 9slice starts at at 32x32, and has 64x64 corner tiles and an 8x8 center.)
local slice = quadSlice.new9Slice(32,32, 64,64, 8,8, 64,64, image:getWidth(), image:getHeight())

function love.draw()
	local mx, my = love.mouse.getPosition()

	quadSlice.draw(image, slice, 32, 32, mx - 32, my - 32)
end
```


# Features


* Can draw 9-Slices with `love.graphics.draw` or add them to a [LÖVE SpriteBatch](https://love2d.org/wiki/SpriteBatch).

* Toggle the visibility of individual tiles.

* Mirroring of the right column and/or bottom row of tiles.

* Make 9-Slice subsets (3x1, 2x3, etc.) by specifying zero-width columns or zero-height rows.

* Helper functions to get UV and vertex coordinates for [LÖVE mesh objects](https://love2d.org/wiki/Mesh).


# Limitations


* All tiles for a given slice must be located on the same texture.

* No built-in support for repeating patterns in center or edge tiles. (Drawing a repeating pattern in the center isn't too difficult, if you're willing to break autobatching -- see `test_rep_pattern.lua` for an example.)

* Slices may have artifacts if you draw at a non-integer scale, or otherwise use coordinates or dimensions that are "off-grid."


# Slice Defs

When creating a slice definition, you must provide coordinates and dimensions for a 3x3 grid which covers part of the texture you wish to draw: `x`, `y`, `w1`, `h1`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, and `h3`. From these coordinates, up to nine LÖVE Quads are generated and stored in an array:

```
   x    w1   w2   w3
y  +----+----+----+
   |q1  |q2  |q3  |
h1 +----+----+----+
   |q4  |q5  |q6  |
h2 +----+----+----+
   |q7  |q8  |q9  |
h3 +----+----+----+
```

If the width or height of a row or column is zero, then the associated tiles are given a shared, non-functional quad with dimensions of `0, 0`. The quad indices remain the same.

Note that due to tile mirroring, the LÖVE Quad positions and dimensions may not match the info stored in the slice table.


# API: Slice table creation

## quadSlice.newSlice

Creates a new slice definition.

`local slice = quadSlice.newSlice(x,y, w1,h1, w2,h2, w3,h3, iw,ih)`

* `x`: Left X position of the tile mosaic in the texture.

* `y`: Top Y position of the tile mosaic.

* `w1`: Width of the left column of tiles. (Must be >= 0)

* `h1`: Height of the top row of tiles. (Must be >= 0)

* `w2`: Width of the middle column of tiles. (Must be >= 0)

* `h2`: Height of the middle row of tiles. (Must be >= 0)

* `w3`: Width of the right column of tiles. (Must be >= 0)

* `h3`: Height of the bottom row of tiles. (Must be >= 0)

* `iw`: Width of the reference image. (Should always be > 0)

* `ih`: Height of the reference image. (Should always be > 0)


**Returns:** a Slice definition table.


# API: Slice state


## Slice:setMirroring


Modifies the quads in a 9slice by mirroring the right column and/or bottom row with those on the opposite side. The image used must have the `mirroredrepeat` [WrapMode](https://love2d.org/wiki/WrapMode) set on the desired axes.

`Slice:setMirroring(mirror_h, mirror_v)`

* `mirror_h`: When true, the right column mirrors the left column.

* `mirror_v`: When true, the bottom row mirrors the top row.


**Notes:** Mirroring works by rewriting the viewport coordinates of certain quads.

* H-mirrored slices:

  * Quads 3, 6 and 9 are reversed versions of 1, 4 and 7, with negative X positions.


* V-mirrored slices:

  * Quads 7, 8 and 9 are reversed versions of 1, 2 and 3, with negative Y positions.


* HV-mirrored slices:

  * Quads 3 and 6 are h-flipped versions of 1 and 4.

  * Quads 7 and 8 are v-flipped versions of 1 and 2.

  * Quad 9 is an h-flipped and v-flipped version of 1.



## Slice:setTileEnabled

Enables or disables a tile within a slice.

`Slice:setTileEnabled(index, enabled)`

* `index`: The tile index.

* `enabled`: `true` to show the tile, `false` or `nil` to hide it.


**Notes:**

* Tile indices go left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Index #1 is the top-left tile.


## Slice:resetTiles

Resets the visibility of all tiles and refreshes their quad viewports.

`Slice:resetTiles()`


# API: Slice positioning and drawing


## Slice:draw

Draws a slice using calls to [love.graphics.draw](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.draw).

`Slice:draw(texture, x, y, w, h)`

* `texture`: The texture to use.

* `x`: Left X position for drawing.

* `y`: Top Y position for drawing.

* `w`: Width of the mosaic to draw.

* `h`: Height of the mosaic to draw.


**Notes:**

* If `w` or `h` are <= 0, then nothing visible will be drawn. You can reverse a slice by translating and flipping the LÖVE coordinate system (passing -1 as one or both arguments to [love.graphics.scale](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.scale)) and offsetting by the desired width and height:


```lua
function love.draw()
	local x, y, w, h = 64, 64, 128, 128

	love.graphics.translate(math.floor(x + w/2), math.floor(y + h/2))
	love.graphics.scale(-1, -1) -- flips on both axes

	slice:draw(texture, -w/2, -h/2, w, h)
end
```


## Slice:batchAdd


Adds a slice to a [LÖVE SpriteBatch](https://love2d.org/wiki/SpriteBatch).

`Slice:batchAdd(batch, x, y, w, h)`

* `batch`: The LÖVE SpriteBatch to append quads to.

* `x`: Destination left X position within the batch.

* `y`: Destination top Y position within the batch.

* `w`: Width of the mosaic to add.

* `h`: Height of the mosaic to add.


**Returns:** The index of the last quad added to the batch.


**Notes:**

* QuadSlice does not support adding reversed slices (as in, flipping or mirroring the entire mosaic) to SpriteBatches. You can reverse the SpriteBatch itself when drawing, but that also reverses all other quads added to it.


## Slice:batchSet


Sets slice quads within a [LÖVE SpriteBatch](https://love2d.org/wiki/SpriteBatch) at a given index. The indices must already have been populated at an earlier time with sprites.


`Slice:batchSet(batch, index, x, y, w, h)`

* `batch`: The LÖVE SpriteBatch in which to set quads.

* `index`: The initial sprite index.

* `x`: Destination left X position within the batch.

* `y`: Destination top Y position within the batch.

* `w`: Width of the mosaic to set.

* `h`: Height of the mosaic to set.


**Notes:**

* This method always sets nine sprites, even if the slice contains disabled tiles or zero-sized columns and rows.

* As with `Slice:batchAdd`, this function does not support reversed slices.


## Slice:getDrawParams


Gets parameters that are needed to draw a slice's quads at a desired width and height.

`local w1,h1, w2,h2, w3,h3, sw1,sh1, sw2,sh2, sw3,sh3 = Slice:getDrawParams(w, h)`

* `w`: Width of the slice that you want to draw.

* `h`: Height of the slice that you want to draw.


**Returns:** Numerous arguments which are used in the `fromParams` drawing functions: `w1`, `h1`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3`, `sw1`, `sh1`, `sw2`, `sh2`, `sw3`, and `sh3`.


**Notes:**

* This is really an internal function, but it's exposed in case you want to store some calculations when drawing multiple copies of a slice with the same dimensions.


## Slice:drawFromParams
## Slice:batchAddFromParams
## Slice:batchSetFromParams


Variations of `Slice:draw`, `Slice:batchAdd` and `Slice:batchSet` which take parameters returned by `Slice:getDrawParams`.

`Slice:drawFromParams(image, quads, x,y, w1,h1, w2,h2, w3,h3, sw1,sh1, sw2,sh2, sw3,sh3)`

`local index = Slice:batchAddFromParams(batch, quads, x,y, w1,h1, w2,h2, w3,h3, sw1,sh1, sw2,sh2, sw3,sh3)`

`Slice:batchSetFromParams(batch, index, quads, x,y, w1,h1, w2,h2, w3,h3, sw1,sh1, sw2,sh2, sw3,sh3)`

* `image`, `batch`, and `index` are the same as in the main versions of these functions. `quads` is the internal sequence of quads from the slice (ie `slice.quads`).

* `w1`, `h1`, `w2`, `h2`, `w3`, `h3`: Calculated dimensions of columns and rows.

* `sw1`, `sh1`, `sw2`, `sh2`, `sw3`, `sh3`: Drawing scale for each column and row.


## Functions: Mesh helpers


QuadSlice doesn't handle LÖVE meshes directly, but you can use these functions to get the raw vertex and UV coordinates for your own mesh setup and drawing code.


## Slice:getTextureUV


Gets UV offsets which can be used to populate a mesh.

`local sx1,sy1, sx2,sy2, sx3,sy3, sx4,sy4 = Slice:getTextureUV()`


**Returns:** Four pairs of XY coordinates in the range of 0-1, which correspond to the edges around the columns and rows of the 9slice texture.


**Notes:**

* Mirroring assigned with `Slice:setMirroring` won't be detected here, as that is implemented by changing quad viewports, and none of the mesh helper functions touch quads at all.


## Slice:getStretchedVertices


Gets slice vertex positions for a given width and height.


`local x1,y1, x2,y2, x3,y3, x4,y4 = Slice:getStretchedVertices(w, h)`


* `w`: Width for the slice to be drawn.

* `h`: Height for the slice to be drawn.


**Returns:** The following vertex positions: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4`.


# Alternative Draw Functions

The table `quadSlice.draw_functions` contains a set of alternative drawing functions. These functions omit certain tiles, and might be wanted in cases where it is known ahead of time that a slice will only ever have certain tiles enabled.

To apply, overwrite the field `slice.drawFromParams` with the desired function. To remove, set `slice.drawFromParams` to `nil` (so that it picks up the original method through its `__index` class table).

See `test1.lua`, page 5 for a demonstration of each function.

If the alternative functions are not required, the whole table can be deleted.
